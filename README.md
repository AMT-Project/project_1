## Build
Run inside projet folder the command:
```bash
  ./build-image.sh
```

If everything goes well, you can run
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now, your terminal is stuck. Great. Open <http://localhost:4848>

1. Accept the risks
2. Click on ```Applications``` in sidebar
3. Look for ```launch```
4. Forget the opened window, click [this](http://localhost:8080/stack) to see our app
